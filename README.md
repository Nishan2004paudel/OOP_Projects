# OOP in C++

This repository is part of my learning and revision journey in **C++**, where I strengthened core programming and introductory **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts by building multiple small, focused projects.

Each mini project targets specific fundamentals such as **logic building, control flow, functions, OOP principles, file handling, and clean code structure**, reinforcing concepts through hands-on practice.

---

### 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A simple console-based game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it.  
This project focuses on revising **loops, conditional statements, user input/output, and random number generation**.

---

### 🧮 Simple Calculator

A basic command-line calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.  
This project helps revise **functions, switch-case statements, input handling, and program structuring**.

---

### 📝 To-Do List (CLI)

A menu-driven command-line to-do list application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.  
This project focuses on **arrays, loops, functions, pass-by-reference, and basic program flow management**.

---

### 🏦 Bank Account System

A simple bank account management system implemented using classes.  
This project focuses on core **OOP concepts** such as **encapsulation, private data members, public methods**, and object interaction through a menu-driven interface.

---

### 📂 Student Management System

A console-based application to add, view, and save student records to a file.  
This project introduces **structs, arrays of structs, and file handling**, laying the groundwork for more advanced OOP-based systems.

---

### 💾 File-Based Library System

An enhanced library management system with persistent storage.  
This project combines **object-oriented design with file handling**, introducing **data persistence, serialization concepts, and real-world application behavior**.

---

### 🔐 Password Manager (CLI)

A command-line password manager designed to apply **object-oriented programming**, **file handling**, and **real-world data modeling** concepts in a small but practical application.

---

### 💰 Expense Tracker (CLI)

A real-world–inspired expense tracking application built using C++.  
This project reinforces **OOP concepts, file handling, structured data storage**, and basic **data analysis logic**.

---

### 🖥️ Mini Shell (CLI)

A minimal shell implementation that bridges **C++ programming with operating system concepts**.  
It focuses on **process creation, command execution**, and handling built-in commands such as `cd` and `exit` on Linux systems.

---

### 📐 Shape Area Calculator (OOP)

A command-line application demonstrating key **object-oriented programming principles**, particularly **inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction**.  

Different geometric shapes are modeled using a common base class, and area calculations are performed **polymorphically at runtime**.

---

### 🎮 Game Engine–Style Entity System (OOP)

A conceptual, console-based system inspired by real game engines to demonstrate **inheritance, polymorphism, and runtime behavior** in C++.  

Different game entities share a common interface, allowing them to be updated and rendered through base-class references-illustrating how engines manage diverse objects without depending on their concrete implementations.

---

### 📇 Contact Management System (CLI)

A menu-driven command-line application that allows users to add, view, search, and delete contacts.
This project focuses on applying object-oriented programming principles, using STL vectors for dynamic data storage, and implementing file handling for persistent data storage, simulating a simple real-world contact management system.

---

### 🎮 Virtual Pet Simulator (CLI)

A menu-driven command-line application that allows users to adopt, feed, play with, and interact with virtual pets.
This project demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in C++, while applying OOP principles and building a fun, real-world–inspired simulation.

More mini projects will be added progressively to continue strengthening **C++ and object-oriented programming fundamentals**.
