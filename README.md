# OOP in C++ 

This repository is part of my learning and revision journey in C++, where I revised and strengthened core programming and introductory OOP concepts by building multiple small and focused projects.  
Each mini project targets specific fundamentals such as logic building, control flow, functions, and clean code structure, helping reinforce concepts through hands-on practice.

### 🎯 Number Guessing Game
A simple console-based game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it.  
This project focuses on revising loops, conditional statements, user input/output, and random number generation.

---

### 🧮 Simple Calculator
A basic command-line calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.  
This project helps revise functions, switch-case statements, input handling, and program structuring.

### 📝 To-Do List (CLI)
A menu-driven command-line to-do list application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.  
This project focuses on arrays, loops, functions, pass-by-reference, and basic program flow management.

### 🏦 Bank Account System
A simple bank account management system implemented using classes.  
This project focuses on core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, private data members, public methods, and object interaction through a menu-driven interface.

More mini projects will be added progressively to continue strengthening C++ and OOP fundamentals.
