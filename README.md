# OOP in C++ 

This repository is part of my learning and revision journey in C++, where I revised and strengthened core programming and introductory OOP concepts by building multiple small and focused projects.  
Each mini project targets specific fundamentals such as logic building, control flow, functions, and clean code structure, helping reinforce concepts through hands-on practice.

### 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A simple console-based game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it.  
This project focuses on revising loops, conditional statements, user input/output, and random number generation.

---

### 🧮 Simple Calculator

A basic command-line calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.  
This project helps revise functions, switch-case statements, input handling, and program structuring.

---

### 📝 To-Do List (CLI)

A menu-driven command-line to-do list application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.  
This project focuses on arrays, loops, functions, pass-by-reference, and basic program flow management.

---

### 🏦 Bank Account System

A simple bank account management system implemented using classes.  
This project focuses on core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, private data members, public methods, and object interaction through a menu-driven interface.

### 📂 Student Management System

A console-based application to add, view, and save student records in a file.  
This project introduces **structs, arrays of structs, and file handling**, laying the groundwork for real OOP programs.

---

### 💾 File-Based Library System

An enhanced version of the library management system with persistent storage.  
This project combines OOP with file handling to save and load data, introducing serialization, deserialization, and real-world application behavior.

---

## 🔐 Password Manager (CLI)

This project focuses on applying **object-oriented programming concepts**, **file handling**, and **real-world data modeling** in a small but practical application.

---

## 💰 Expense Tracker (CLI)

This project focuses on building a **real-world application** while reinforcing **object-oriented programming concepts**, **file handling**, and **basic data analysis logic**.

---

## 🖥️ Mini Shell (CLI)

This project bridges **C++ programming with operating system concepts**, focusing on process creation and command execution in Linux.

The shell continuously accepts user commands, executes system programs, and supports basic built-in commands such as `cd` and `exit`.

---

## 📐 Shape Area Calculator (OOP)

A command-line application built to demonstrate **core object-oriented programming principles** in C++, particularly **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**.  

Different geometric shapes are modeled using a common base class, and area calculation is handled polymorphically at runtime.

More mini projects will be added progressively to continue strengthening C++ and OOP fundamentals.
